# Intro
3 years ago, I went to the Great Smoky Mountains with a group of my friends for our Student Fellowship retreat. And I took this beautiful picture there. The view is so amazing. That made me to think about how great our God is for creating all these creations. 

When you are at the top of a mountain, you can often see things you never would have thought you could see when you were on the ground below. 
Today, we will learn about a time three of Jesus’ followers saw something miraculous at the top of a mountain. Whether this is your first time or your tenth time hearing this story, there is always something new to learn in God’s Word.

# Big picture question
We’ve been studying a big picture question and answer about Jesus’ miracles. Remember that a miracle is something done by God’s power that would normally be impossible. 

## after showing answer 
When Jesus did impossible things, it proved that He has power over creation. It demonstrated that He is God the Son. He also used miracles to meet people’s needs for food, healing, and safety.

# Gaint Timeline
The Bible tells us what is true about God and about ourselves. All of the stories in the Bible fit together to tell us the big story of how God rescues sinners through His Son, Jesus.

---
We learned that `Jesus calmed a storm to show the disciples He is God`. 
He protected His disciples from sinking and showed His power. 

---
We also talked about the time `Jesus miraculously fed a crowd with five loaves and two fish`. 
Again, Jesus was showing compassion on the hungry people and proving that He is God.

---
When another storm put the disciples in danger, `Jesus showed He is God by walking on water`. They all worshiped Him and glorified God after that. 

---
This week, we will look at a story called `“Jesus Showed His Glory.”`

# Tell the Bible story

As Jesus traveled and taught, people were trying to figure Him out. Who was this man? Was He a prophet? Was He crazy? Where did He come from? Some people thought He was John the Baptist who had been raised from the dead; others thought He was Elijah or another ancient prophet. Peter recognized Jesus as God’s Messiah. 

---
One of the ways Jesus revealed His identity was through His miracles. Jesus performed miracles to glorify God, to show He is the Son of God, and to care for people. For three of Jesus’ disciples—Peter, James, and John—Jesus’ identity became even more clear when they witnessed His transfiguration, or change in appearance. The disciples accompanied Jesus to a mountain to pray. The location was likely Mount Hermon, which sits about 40 miles north of the Sea of Galilee. 

---
Jesus’ appearance changed as He prayed: His face changed and His clothes became dazzling white. 
Mark wrote that Jesus’ clothing was whiter than any person could get them no matter how he or she washed them. 
Matthew explained that Jesus’ face shone like the sun! It would have been an incredible sight. Jesus’ glory is bright and intense, but it’s more than just a light.

---
Moses and Elijah appeared with Him, and they talked about Jesus’ upcoming departure (His death and resurrection). In the Old Testament, God called Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Later, Elijah was a prophet to Israel. 
Peter, James, and John had been sleeping, but they awoke to the incredible sight. 

---
As Moses and Elijah were leaving, a cloud covered the whole group and a voice—God the Father’s—said, “This is my Son, the Chosen One; listen to him!” 


# Christ connection
Jesus is more than a good man or a wise teacher, He is God the Son. The Bible tells us He is the image of the invisible God. He is the King of kings. All things were created by Him and for Him. Without Him, all of creation could no longer exist. When Peter, James, and John saw Jesus in His glory, they saw who Jesus really is more clearly than they ever had before.
 

This story tells of the first time Jesus revealed His glory to humans, but it will not be the last time humans see Jesus in glory. When Jesus returns to earth wearing bright white clothing and shining brighter than the sun, He will destroy all evil and fix everything wrong in the world. Everyone who has faith in Jesus will receive new, glorified bodies to live forever with God.

---
At the transfiguration, Peter, James, and John beheld Jesus’ glory. We look forward to the day when Jesus will return in full glory to make all things new. While we wait, God calls us to share the gospel with others so they can share in the joy of knowing Jesus, the Son of God, and seeing His glory when He returns. 
# Key Passage
Psalm 40:5 tells us that God’s works and plans are wonderful. We see this very clearly in Jesus’ ministry. Jesus taught about God and met people’s needs in miraculous ways. 

# Questions Time
One of Jesus’ most impressive miracles happened when Jesus showed His glory to Peter, James, and John. Jesus wanted them to know for sure that He is God. Jesus will return in glory someday to restore the world and destroy all evil. 

# Prayer
Lord God, You are worthy of all glory and honor. We look forward to the day when we will enjoy Your presence forever. Be gracious to us, Father, and show kindness to us. We pray that all the people of the earth would know You and trust in You so that they would one day see Your glory too. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
